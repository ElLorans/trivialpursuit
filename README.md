Trivial Pursuit Game Board
==========================

A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trivial_Pursuit">Trivial Pursuit</a> game with movable pieces and pie wedges. Works in most browsers (HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript required).

The game board and logo are a custom design because this was created for a specific event, but it should be fairly easy to swap in your own.
